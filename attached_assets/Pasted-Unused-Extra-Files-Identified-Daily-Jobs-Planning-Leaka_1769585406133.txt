Detailed Folder Cleanup List: If we proceed, these folders are safe to remove as they pertain to Features (Daily Jobs/Salary) that belong in the daily-planning library, not the admin library:
core-ui-admin-library/src/lib/core/domain/models/DailyJobs core-ui-admin-library/src/lib/core/domain/models/Salary core-ui-admin-library/src/lib/core/domain/models/SalaryLine core-ui-admin-library/src/lib/presentation/settings/deadline-periods core-ui-admin-library/src/lib/presentation/settings/syncing
PLease remove these carefully
