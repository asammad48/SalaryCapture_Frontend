I understand you want Replit to handle this automatically. Here's how to ask Replit AI to fix the build issue and deployment commands:

## Ask Replit AI Assistant:

**Type this in Replit's AI chat:**
```
Please fix this Nx build error in my Angular monorepo. The build is failing because @embrace-it/salary-calculation-library cannot be found. 

Error: Cannot find module '@embrace-it/salary-calculation-library'

Please:
1. Check if all dependencies are properly configured
2. Verify tsconfig path mappings
3. Ensure all workspace libraries are built in correct order
4. Fix any missing imports or configuration issues
```

## Deployment Commands for Production:

**Build for production:**
```bash
# Build all projects for production
nx run-many --target=build --configuration=production --all

# Or build specific project for production
nx build core-ui-daily-planning-library --configuration=production

# With optimization
nx build core-ui-daily-planning-library --prod --optimization
```

**Create production build with Nx:**
```bash
# Build affected projects for production
nx affected:build --configuration=production

# Build with specific base (for CI/CD)
nx affected:build --base=origin/main --head=HEAD --configuration=production
```

**Deployment preparation:**
```bash
# Create production build output
nx build --configuration=production

# The built files will be in:
# dist/core-ui-daily-planning-library/
```

**Common production deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Build
nx build core-ui-daily-planning-library --prod

# 2. Deploy to your hosting service
# For example, if using Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/core-ui-daily-planning-library

# For AWS S3:
aws s3 sync dist/core-ui-daily-planning-library/ s3://your-bucket-name/ --delete
```

**Ask Replit AI for deployment help:**
```
Please help me deploy my Nx Angular library to production. Provide the complete deployment pipeline including:
1. Production build configuration
2. Deployment target setup
3. Environment variables configuration
4. Recommended hosting options
```

The Replit AI should automatically detect your project structure and fix the dependency issues while providing appropriate deployment commands for your specific setup.
